Project 1 Steganography

README.md

The data files (image pixels) will start with a line indicating particular features of its image data.  The line will say "Alpha=no" or "Alpha=yes" depending on whether the Alpha values are included.  You can assume that each image has dimensions 64 by 64 pixels; if not, the dimensions will be included in that first line of text as "Dimensions=wxh", where 'w' and 'x' are decimal integers.
