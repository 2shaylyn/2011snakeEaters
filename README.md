Steganography: The process of embedding secret information into a larger data structure.
Abstract Data Type
  Get Details about the image
    File type, Format detail, Image Size
  Read a message to be hidden
  Convert the message into binary data
  See if the carrier image is large enough to hide the message
  If the image is large enough, iterate over all pixels in the image and the message and alter the least-significant bit in each pixel and    record the new pixel value as a new image
  Save the new image
  Read an image and find a hidden message
